# Crowd-Monitoring-System-Using-Deep-Learning
This project implements a deep learning-based system to monitor crowd density in video frames. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the system classifies frames into three categories: low, medium, and high crowd density. It is designed for applications in public safety, event management, and surveillance.
